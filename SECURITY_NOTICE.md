# Security Configuration Notice

## API Key Security

Your Firebase API key has been removed from the source code and moved to environment variables.

### Required Actions:

1. **Apply API Key Restrictions in Google Cloud Console**
   - Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
   - Find your API key
   - Add HTTP referrer restrictions for your domains
   - Restrict API access to only Firebase services

2. **For Local Development**
   - Use `.env.local` file (already created)
   - This file is gitignored and won't be committed

3. **For Production Deployment**
   - Set environment variables in your hosting platform:
     - Vercel: Project Settings > Environment Variables
     - Netlify: Site Settings > Environment Variables
     - Firebase Hosting: Use Firebase Functions for config

4. **Important Notes**
   - Firebase web API keys are meant to be public but must be restricted
   - Never commit `.env.local` to version control
   - Always use environment variables for sensitive configuration

### Environment Variables Required:
```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID
```

### Security Best Practices Implemented:
- ✅ API keys removed from source code
- ✅ Environment variables configured
- ✅ .gitignore updated
- ✅ Example env file provided

### Next Steps:
1. Commit these changes
2. Remove the exposed commit from Git history (optional but recommended)
3. Apply API restrictions in Google Cloud Console
4. Configure production environment variables
