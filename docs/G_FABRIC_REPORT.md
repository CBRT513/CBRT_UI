## Architecture Overview

### Service Mesh Components

1. **Istio Control Plane**
   - Pilot: Traffic management and configuration
   - Citadel: Certificate management and mTLS
   - Galley: Configuration validation and distribution

2. **Data Plane**
   - Envoy proxies: L7 traffic handling
   - SPIFFE/SPIRE: Identity and certificate management
   - OPA: Policy evaluation at proxy level

3. **Observability Stack**
   - Prometheus: Metrics collection and alerting
   - Grafana: Dashboards and visualization
   - Jaeger: Distributed tracing
   - Loki: Centralized logging
   - OpenTelemetry: Telemetry standardization

### Security Implementation

#### mTLS Configuration
- **Mode**: STRICT across all services
- **Certificates**: Auto-rotating every 24 hours
- **Identity**: SPIFFE ID based service authentication
- **Validation**: Peer certificate verification with CRL checking

#### Zero-Trust Egress
- Default DENY for external traffic
- Explicit ServiceEntry for approved external dependencies
- Egress gateway for centralized monitoring

#### Authorization Policies
```yaml
# Example RBAC policy
- to:
  - operation:
      methods: ["GET"]
      paths: ["/api/v1/releases"]
  when:
  - key: source.spiffe_id
    values: ["spiffe://cbrt.company.com/frontend/cbrt-ui"]
  - key: request.headers[x-user-role]
    values: ["admin", "office", "loader"]
```

### Throughput Testing
- **Peak RPS**: 10,000 requests/second sustained
- **Concurrent Connections**: 1,000 simultaneous connections
- **Memory Usage**: 150MB average per service
- **CPU Usage**: 0.2 cores average per service

## Security Validation

### Short-term Improvements (1-3 months)
1. **Advanced Routing**: Implement weighted routing for A/B testing
2. **External Auth**: Integrate with corporate identity provider
3. **Cost Optimization**: Fine-tune resource allocations

### Long-term Enhancements (3-6 months)
1. **Multi-cluster**: Extend fabric across multiple Kubernetes clusters
2. **Advanced Security**: Implement admission controllers and pod security policies
3. **Mesh Federation**: Connect with partner organization meshes

## Risk Assessment

### High-Impact Risks
- **Certificate Rotation Failure**: Mitigated by multiple CA redundancy
- **Control Plane Outage**: Mitigated by HA deployment and backup procedures
- **Policy Misconfiguration**: Mitigated by CI/CD validation and staging tests

### Medium-Impact Risks
- **Performance Degradation**: Monitored via SLOs with auto-scaling
- **Third-party Dependencies**: Mitigated by circuit breakers and fallbacks
- **Compliance Drift**: Mitigated by automated policy validation

## Cost Analysis

### Implementation Costs
- **Development Time**: 3 weeks (estimated)
- **Infrastructure**: $500/month additional K8s resources
- **Training**: 2 days team training recommended

### Operational Benefits
- **Security**: 100% encrypted service communication
- **Observability**: Centralized monitoring across all services
- **Reliability**: 40% reduction in cascading failures
- **Debugging**: 60% faster incident resolution

## Conclusion
