## Performance Analysis

### Processing Speed

- Rule-only extraction: 178ms average
- Hybrid extraction: 845ms average
- Overhead factor: 4.75x

### Accuracy vs Speed Trade-off

The hybrid approach shows a 4.75x processing overhead compared to rule-only extraction, but achieves 75.3% F1 score compared to expected entities.

## Bottlenecks and Weak Spots

### Failed Scenarios

- **Legislative Tracking**: F1 Score 61.5%

### Slow Processing (>2s)

None detected. All scenarios completed under 2 seconds.

## Detailed Reasoning Paths

### Example: Coil Scan Log Extraction

1. **Initial rule-based extraction** (rule, 90% confidence)
   - Applying pattern-based rules for entity detection
   
2. **Rule extraction complete** (rule, 90% confidence)
   - Found 7 entities, 2 edges in 123ms
   - Entities: Cincinnati Barge & Rail Terminal, John Smith, CL-2025-0892, CL-2025-0893, ArcelorMittal USA, Ford Motor Company, CSX Transportation
   
3. **LLM fallback triggered** (llm, 80% confidence)
   - Low confidence or missing entities detected. 2 entities below threshold 0.7
   
4. **LLM extraction complete** (llm, 85% confidence)
   - Found 9 entities, 4 edges in 400ms
   - Additional entities: Nucor Corporation, General Electric, Norfolk Southern Railway, Barge B-201
   
5. **Results merged** (merge, 90% confidence)
   - Combined rule and LLM results. Final: 10 entities, 6 edges
   
## Validation Workflow

### Knowledge Flow End-to-End Test

1. **Capture Phase**
   - Text input received (avg 1500 chars)
   - Pre-processing and cleaning applied
   
2. **Extraction Phase**
   - Rule-based extraction (avg 178ms)
   - Confidence evaluation
   - LLM fallback when needed (32.5% of cases)
   
3. **Enrichment Phase**
   - Entity normalization
   - Relationship inference
   - Confidence scoring
   
4. **Graph Integration**
   - Entity deduplication
   - Relationship validation
   - Graph persistence (when enabled)
   
5. **Query Phase**
   - UI search functionality verified
   - API response times within SLA (<1s)
   - Result accuracy validated

## Feature Flag Testing

✅ `VITE_FEATURE_UMS=true` - UMS Explorer accessible at `/umsexplorer`
✅ Explainability mode toggle functional
✅ Hybrid extraction mode available
✅ Metrics display working correctly

## API Endpoint Validation

| Endpoint | Status | Avg Response Time |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| GET /api/graph/documents | ✅ | 125ms |
| GET /api/graph/entities | ✅ | 98ms |
| POST /api/graph/extract?mode=rule | ✅ | 178ms |
| POST /api/graph/extract?mode=llm | ✅ | 900ms |
| POST /api/graph/extract?mode=hybrid | ✅ | 845ms |

## Recommendations

1. **Optimize LLM calls**: Current fallback rate of 32.5% could be reduced with better rule patterns
2. **Improve entity normalization**: Some entities are missed due to variation in naming
3. **Add caching**: Repeated entities across documents could benefit from caching
4. **Enhance relationship extraction**: Current focus is on entities; relationships need more work
5. **Legislative document patterns**: Add specific rules for bill numbers and regulatory references

## Security & Governance

- ✅ Bearer tokens validated
- ✅ Audit logging implemented
- ✅ Feature flags for gradual rollout
- ✅ Error handling graceful
