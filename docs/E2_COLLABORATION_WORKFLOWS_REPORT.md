      type: StepType.APPROVAL,
      mode: 'sequential',
      approvers: [{ type: 'role', value: 'document_reviewer' }],
      timeout: 300000, // 5 minutes
      escalation: {
        timeoutMs: 600000,
        escalateTo: [{ type: 'role', value: 'senior_reviewer' }],
        autoApprove: false
      }
    },
    {
      id: 'financial_approval',
