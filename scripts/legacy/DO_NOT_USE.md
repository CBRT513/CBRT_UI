# ⚠️ DO NOT USE - Legacy Seed Scripts

## IMPORTANT: Seeding is disabled by policy

These scripts have been archived and must not be used in production or staging environments.

### Why these scripts are disabled:
- Company policy requires clean, empty databases for Dev and Staging
- All test data must be entered manually through the UI
- Automated seeding can mask bugs and create false positives

### Archived files:
- `seedReleases.html` - DO NOT USE
- `seedF8Test.html` - DO NOT USE  
- `seed-data.js` - DO NOT USE
- `seedTestReleases.js` - DO NOT USE

### If you need test data:
1. Use the application UI to manually create test records
2. Document your test data creation steps
3. Never commit seed data to the repository

**Violation of this policy may result in deployment failures and security review.**
