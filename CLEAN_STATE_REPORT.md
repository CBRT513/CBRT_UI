## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Seed Scripts Disabled
- All seed scripts moved to `/scripts/legacy/`
- NPM scripts return error if invoked
- Legacy folder contains `DO_NOT_USE.md` warning

### 2. CI/CD Guards
- GitHub Actions checks for seed script usage
- Build fails if seeding detected
- No automatic data population

### 3. Code Review Requirements
- CODEOWNERS requires approval for:
  - `/scripts/` directory
  - `/firestore.rules`
  - `/.github/workflows/`
  - `/.firebaserc`

### 4. Package.json Guards
```json
"seed:dev": "echo 'ERROR: Seeding is disabled by policy.' && exit 1",
"seed:staging": "echo 'ERROR: Seeding is disabled by policy.' && exit 1"
```

## Verification Steps

### Empty State UI Verification
1. **Ops Queues** (`/ops/queues`)
   - Pick tab: "No releases in this queue yet"
   - Verify tab: "No releases in this queue yet"
   - BOL tab: "No releases in this queue yet"

2. **Data Import** (`/dataimport`)
   - Shows empty import interface
   - No pre-existing data

3. **All Manager Pages**
   - Staff Manager: Empty
   - Customer Manager: Empty
   - Supplier Manager: Empty
   - All other managers: Empty

## Deployment Configuration

### Auth Provider Settings

#### DEV (cbrt-app-ui-dev)
- ✅ Email/Password: ENABLED
- ✅ Google Auth: ENABLED
- ✅ Anonymous: ENABLED
- ❌ Domain Restriction: NONE

#### STAGING (cbrt-ui-staging)
- ✅ Email/Password: ENABLED
- ✅ Google Auth: ENABLED (restrict to @cbrt.com)
- ❌ Anonymous: DISABLED
- ✅ Domain Restriction: @cbrt.com only

## Compliance Checklist

- [x] All seed scripts removed from active directories
- [x] NPM seed commands return errors
- [x] CI/CD checks prevent seeding
- [x] CODEOWNERS configured for sensitive files
- [x] Wipe scripts require explicit confirmation
- [x] Environment files exclude seed flags
- [x] Documentation updated with no-seed policy

## Manual Data Entry Instructions

For testing, data must be entered manually through the UI:

1. **Create Staff:** Navigate to `/staff` and add users
2. **Create Customers:** Use `/customers` interface
3. **Create Releases:** Use `/enterarelease` form
4. **Stage/Verify/Load:** Use `/ops/queues` workflow

## Policy Statement

**NO AUTOMATED SEEDING POLICY**

This project maintains a strict no-seeding policy for all environments:
- All test data must be created manually through the UI
- Automated seeding scripts are disabled and must not be re-enabled
- This policy ensures data integrity and prevents test data contamination

## Next Steps

1. Execute wipe commands for both environments
2. Deploy clean builds to both environments
3. Configure auth providers in Firebase Console
4. Begin manual testing with UI-created data only
